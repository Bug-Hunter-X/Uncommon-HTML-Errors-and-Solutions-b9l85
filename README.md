# Uncommon HTML Errors and Solutions

This repository contains examples of uncommon HTML errors and their solutions.  The `bug.html` file demonstrates the errors, and `bugSolution.html` shows the corrected code.

## Common Errors

* **Unclosed tags:**  Forgetting to close tags like `div`, `p`, `span`, etc., is a frequent source of problems.  The browser may misinterpret the structure of the page, causing layout issues and unexpected behavior.
* **Incorrect nesting:** Tags must be nested correctly.  Improper nesting can result in elements being rendered in unexpected places or not at all.
* **Missing attributes:**  Certain HTML elements require specific attributes. Missing these can cause elements to render incorrectly or not function as expected.
* **Invalid characters:**  Using characters that are not allowed in HTML can cause parsing errors.  Always use proper character encoding.

## Solutions

The provided solutions focus on:

* **Proper tag closure:** Ensure each opening tag has a corresponding closing tag.
* **Correct nesting:** Check the hierarchy and order of nested tags.
* **Complete attributes:** Ensure all required attributes are present and correctly formatted.
* **Valid characters:** Use only allowed characters in the HTML code.
