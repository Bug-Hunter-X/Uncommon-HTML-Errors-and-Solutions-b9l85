<p>This is a common error that occurs when the HTML is not properly formatted or when there are syntax errors in the HTML code. It can also happen when the HTML file is not properly encoded or when the web browser is unable to parse the HTML code correctly.</p><p>For example, if you have an unclosed tag, such as <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, then the browser will not be able to render the rest of the HTML code correctly. This will cause a variety of errors, including the one you are seeing.</p><p>The solution to this problem is to carefully check your HTML code for any syntax errors and to ensure that all of the tags are properly closed. You should also check the encoding of the HTML file to make sure that it is properly encoded. If the problem persists, then you may need to try a different web browser.</p>
